# Juldeck intro

Juldeck is a tool for streamers that alows them to asssign unused parts of the keyboard into a stream deck that can switch scenes, mute and unmute mic and many more things.

# How To Use

After downloading Juldeck.exe opening it will add it to the bottom right of the tool bar, at this point it should be runing(I only have the PrtSc key cluster devolped). I have only tested this with obs but I am sure this should work on other streaming platforms. To assign a key to a hotkey simpy press the key you want they hotkey to be assinged to.
